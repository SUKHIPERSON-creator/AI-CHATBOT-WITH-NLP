# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
SIMPLE chatbot with use of net working with nltk

                                Simple NLP-Based Python Chatbot
This is a basic chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot can understand simple user inputs like greetings, questions about the weather, name, age, or goodbyes and respond accordingly. It uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for tokenization and lemmatization of user inputs to improve intent matching.

üìö Features
Detects simple intents like greetings, farewells, thanks, and weather questions.

Preprocesses user input using tokenization and lemmatization.

Matches user input to predefined intents.

Responds with random responses from a list of replies for each intent.

                        How It Works
Preprocessing:

User input is converted to lowercase and tokenized.

Each token is lemmatized to reduce it to its base form (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").

Intent Matching:

Input is matched against predefined patterns for each intent.

If a pattern matches all tokens in user input, the corresponding intent is selected.

Responding:

A random response related to the detected intent is selected and printed.
